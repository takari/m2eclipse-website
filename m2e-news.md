# M2Eclipse 1.6.0.M1 Released

We are working toward the 1.6.0 release which will be part of Mars. The first milestone release fixes a few issues and you can find the details [here](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?order=Importance&product=m2e&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=1.6.0%2FMars%20M1).

We are very happy that [Fred Bricon][1] from Red Hat will take over the duties of getting M2Eclipse into the release train. This requires a lot of work and we're happy this work is now being distributed :-) Thanks Fred!
